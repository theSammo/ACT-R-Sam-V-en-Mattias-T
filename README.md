To run the code you need the following:
- A Python 2.7 environment
- ccmsuite installed on that environment. To do that, do the following:
	- Clone the GitHub repo at https://github.com/tcstewar/ccmsuite
	- Navigate to this folder on your PC in a command prompt with an active Python 2.7 environment. We used Anaconda.
	- run conda setup.py install
After this you can run the code from your IDE using your python 2.7 environment.
